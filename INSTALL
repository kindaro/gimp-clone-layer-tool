INSTALL
=======

For Linux and Unix users
------------------------
For a system wide installation simply state:

	$gimptool-2.0 --install clone-layer-tool.c

A restart of The GIMP is recommended.

For Window users
------------------------
C:\gimptool-2.0 --install-admin c:\pach_to_plugin_src\clone-layer-tool.c

!!! Note !!! 
1. If your GIMP was installed to \Program Files\, you must reinstall it into 
	folder which non contains a blank space in the name!
	i.e.: c:\gimp\ or d:\gimp_2.7\, ...

2. gimptool-2.0 required GTK+ libs and installed  MiniGW! 
	Please install all needed soft and libs on your machine before compile plugin using gimptool-2.0.  


Other platforms
---------------
I'm sorry I have no knowledge on how to install plugins on other platforms. I
hope others will find a way.
