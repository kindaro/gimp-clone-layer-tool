CloneLayer Tool (CLT) is a C plugin for Gimp 2.7 to automatically duplicate 
layers and apply to them some transformation and visual effects like - rotate, 
scale, move, blur and others....
This plugin works like batch processor which helps to make a set of clone 
layers with transformation on each of them.
Plugin shows the all change in "live mode" - on the gimp canvas (just set 
needed values and click on the "Clone"). 

NOTE!
========
CLT-v2.0b is in beta testing and it makes a mess in GIMP Undo stack! Please, 
save your work before apply this plugin, or make duplicate image!

INSTALLATION
================

See the file INSTALL for instructions how to install the plugins.


USAGE
==================

Once the plugin is installed successfully, the plugin can be found in The GIMP
using the menu "Layer->Clone-Layer Tool...". 
It works for full image on the current layer.  The selected region is ignored. (It will fixed in further)
 
 The plugin dialog allows to adjust many parameters which sorted by groups:

	The General Parameters:
		
		Clone Times - how many clones must be created  - from 1 to 1000;
		
		Interpolation - uses for transformation;
		
		Add clone layers as - 
			- One layer - it will merge all clones to one layer;
			- Grouping clone layers;
			- Each clone to layer;

		Autocroping layer - 
			if checked - remove empty borders from the layer;
			else - change layer to image size;

		Orders - 
			- UP - add new clone above previous layer ;
			- DOWN - add new clone under previous layer;
			
		Add Background -> BG or FG -
			blending cloned layers with background or foreground color.
			
			This option may be usefull for layer animation, when image 
			placed on the clean layer and has a some transparency.
				(In this case, after convertion to indexed colors the image 
				may break a soft color transition. To avoid this effect, it
				is necessary to replace alpha channel of the image to any 
				color - to background or foreground.) 
	
	Resize (scale) group:     
		- provides some values to set a fixed and random step to increase/decrease width or height of layer. 
		Keep aspect - enabled a proportional scaling.
		Resize Type - sets  direction of resize - to Top/Left corner, etc....
	
	Rotation group:
		- provides parameters to set a fixed and random angle to rotate layer on each clone.
		Coordinates -
			Rotate Center X and Center Y - a rotate points
		Get Coordinates - to set  Center X and Center Y point by corners - Top/Right; Buttom/Left, ect ...
		
	Move group:
		- provides parameters to set a fixed and random step to increase/decrease distance between layers on each clone;
		Move Layer From - selects corners between two layers to set a distance for them.

	Effects group:
		- has a few visual filters (effects) that could be added to layers. 
		At the now, there are five filters:
			Opacity - you can set fixed or random step to increase/decrease transparency.
			Blur - the same, but for the blur.
			Colorize - you can change image hue by fixed or random step.
			Noise Spread - the same like blur, but for the noise spread.
			Drop Shadow - adding shadow under image. 
				(Note, the shadow area don't calculate on Move-steps!)
				
	Animate group:
		- this feature provide a simple way to manage the GIMP animate layers, 
		such as mode animation layer and speed layer.
			On/Off - enable/disable animation setting.
			Animation setting for First/Next and Last layer - 
				Mode layer - [combine|replace|none]
				Speed - speed in ms/ from 0 to 10000.
				
					...each setting will been added to end of layer name. 
						for ex.:   layer_name-clt #1(300ms)(replace)
